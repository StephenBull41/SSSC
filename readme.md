# Support console for remote technicians
Please note this is an example of work done only, it was designed for a very specific enviroment & will be useless outside of its natural habitat.

# What does it do?

The support console was created with the goal of reducing the effort & time an operator need to connect with & diagnose faults on a clients system.
Entering a clients ID allows the console to look up relevent information, poll any expected devices to quickly show network health.

The console allows for many context sensitive actions which allows for things like running general purpose scripts with arguments passed by the console which otherwise would have had to be done by an operator.

Put all together the console enables support analysts to reduce call handling time & increase first call resolution rate by making relevant information imediately available whilst further enabling process automation.

# Design goals

1. Small form factor

The app was designed to fit a remote control session & command prompt on the same screen to save valuable screen realestate(IT please let me have a third screen...)

2. Small resource footprint.

When first devolped the enviroment this app was designed for had very limited resources shared between all support staff, the UI has been kept basic to preserve resources & app responsiveness. No stylish WPF here.

3. Save me time to beat everyone elses KPIs

Worked great until I shared it around :)
